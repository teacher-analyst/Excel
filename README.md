This project is part of Module 1 Challenge of Data Analytics Bootcamp. 

## Project Description

Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to famous celebrities, more and more people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.

To receive funding, the project must meet or exceed an initial goal, so many organisations dedicate considerable resources looking through old projects in an attempt to discover “the trick” to finding success. For this week's Challenge, you will organise and analyse a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover any hidden trends.

#### Deliverables
1. Apply conditional formatting to certain columns to indicate the outcome of campaigns i.e. successful, failed, cancelled or live, with a different colour. Also, use conditional formatting to fill cells in the Percent Funded column according to a three-colour scale.
2. Create three pivot tables and charts. Each chart should have the option to be filtered.
3. Apply formulas to the deadline and launched_at columns to convert the Unix timestamps to a normal date
4. Create a summary statistics stable that summarises the mean, median, minimum, maximum, variance and standard deviation values of backers counts for successful and unsuccessful campaigns.
5. Justification of which value, mean or median, is an accurate summary of the data.
